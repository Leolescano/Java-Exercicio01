best work and apply most of the knowledge acquired.
Homework Week #1
Array Summary
Given a List of Integers create a program that calculates the min(), max() and average() values and
stores the result of each operation into a Class.
Input:
array[] = {1, 2, 3,4}
Output:
{
 min: 1,
 max: 4,
 average: 2.5
}
Racing Vehicules
I have 3 types of racing vehicles, Motorcycle, Bike, Car, each of them has different speeds.
Create a program, that given a distance in meter and the instance of the vehicle, returns the time for
that vehicle took to travel the distance.
Vehicle Speed:
Bike: 6 km/h
Car: 60 km/h
Bike: 80 km/h
Input:
Vehicle: Bike
Distance: 60 km
Output:
10 h
Repository Implementation
Let’s use a List as data repository to store elements.
We need to be able to execute the operations below:
• save: Will receive an element as parameter and, will add the given element to a List.
• count: Will return the number of elements that are in the List.
• find: Will receive an integer as parameters and, will return the element from the list on the
given index.
Notes: The List should only store elements of the same type as the object given.
And, we need store elements of the below types:
• Product: Which has name and stock fields.
• Country: Which has name and iso code fields.
• User: Which has username, first name and last name fields.
